ebook2cw v0.8.5 - convert ebooks to morse code - Fabian Kurz, DJ5CW
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Website: https://fkurz.net/ham/ebook2cw.html

ebook2cw is a command line program which converts a plain text ebook to morse
code MP3 or OGG files. It works on several platforms, including Windows and
Linux.

It automatically splits and numbers the output files by chapters.

For a detailled description, please refer to the man-page or the project
website.


INSTALL
--------
1) Binaries
Statically compiled binaries are available at the project website, for Linux
(i386) and Win32. Those should be suitable for most users.

2) Source
A Makefile is included; it compiles under Linux, Windows (with MinGW) and OS X.
DESTDIR is /usr by default (so the binary will be in /usr/bin/).
Support for LAME and/or OGG can be disabled by USE_LAME=NO and USE_OGG=NO
respectively.

make [DESTDIR=..] [USE_OGG=NO] [USE_LAME=NO]
sudo make install

Build prerequisites (Debian/Ubuntu): build-essential libvorbis-dev libmp3lame-dev

CGI
---
ebook2cw can also be compiled as a CGI, with "make cgi" or "make cgibuffered".
The executable can then be used on a webserver and called in the format

http://example.com/cgi-bin/cw.cgi?s=25&e=25&f=600&t=%20hello%20world

which returns a MP3 file with "hello world" at the given speed etc. The order
of the GET parameters must be used as shown above. Real-world examples of
ebook2cw as a CGI can be found at http://lcwo.net/.

The default cgi version operates "on the fly", the "cgibuffered" option 
first writes the whole MP3/OGG to a temporary file, so it can send a proper
Content-Length: header which may be required for some clients.
